KNewStuff2 - the next generation GHNS
=====================================

This is the stating area which will lead to a much more powerful
KNewStuff library for collaborative data sharing in KDE 4.

Read featureguide.txt for an introduction.

Have a look at doc/*.txt for some documentation, especially the tutorial.

There's also some ideas at http://techbase.kde.org/Projects/KNS2.

Finally, some possible extensions to KNewStuff2 are still in
/branches/work/knewstuff2.
